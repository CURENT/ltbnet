# LTBNet - Network Emulation and PMU Streaming

## Introduction

LTBNet is communication network emulator for power system applications. It 
can be used to a) define the topology of a communication network, b)stream 
measurement data between hosts, and c) stream power system control commands.

The LTBNet configuration links the communication network components with the 
power system measurement devices. Components in the communication network, 
including hosts, links, switches and routers define the network topology, 
while the PMU and PDC hosts define the measurement data streaming hierarchy.

## Installation

Recommended Environment:
  - Ubuntu 16.04.5 with Python 3.5
  - [Mininet Fork](https://github.com/cuihantao/mininet/tree/py3) 
  - [PyPMU Fork](https://github.com/cuihantao/pypmu)

LTBNet is built on top of Mininet and PyPMU. It is recommended to install the 
provided forks. Note that the earlier versions of Mininet without Python 3 
support will not work. The PyPMU fork also have some important changes.

Mininet can only run on Linux systems. We recommend Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS. 
Follow the 
[instructions here (Option 2)](http://mininet.org/download/#option-2-native-installation-from-source)
to install Mininet on a fresh environment. You will need superuser access to 
install and run Mininet.

PyPMU can be installed by running `pip install .` in the PyPMU project 
directory. PyPMU only works in Python 3.

Finally, LTBNet can be installed with `pip install .` in the LTBNet project 
directory. The installation will attempt to create two console entry points: 
`ltbnet` and `minipmu`.

`ltbnet` is the main program to create a communication network topology and 
instantiate PMU instances. `minipmu` is an independent program to create a 
PMU instance that a) receives data from [ANDES](https://github.com/cuihantao/andes)
through DiME, and b) implements the IEEE C37.118-2011 protocol for data 
streaming over TCP/IP.

## Configuration Files
Example configuration files can be found in the folder `data`. A 
configuration file defines how the network should be created. 

### File format
Two formats are currently supported: CSV and JSON. We are migrating from CSV 
to JSON as the latter offers more flexibility. 

The fields in the CSV or the JSON file annotates the components. For each 
component, `Type` is an identifier of the type of the device. Supported 
values for `Type` and their meaning are the follows:

 - Region: power system region, which generally contains one PDC and 
 multiple PMUs
 - Switch: network switch
 - Router: network router
 - PDC: phasor data concentrator. A PDC concentrates data within the region 
 and sends data to other PDCs when requested
 - PMU: phasor measurement unit. A PMU measures the bus voltage, frequency 
 (and possibly but not implemented, current)at the given bus (es). It is a
 host in the communication network
 - Link: communication link between any two communication network elements
 - HwIntf: hardware interface. Allow to attach hardware interface to the 
 emulated network

A complete table of the supported fields for each type of component is listed 
below.

Note:
 - `<` means the same as the left
 - `-` means not applicable. In CSV files, the field should be filled with 
 literal `None`
 - The fields `Delay`, `BW`, `Loss` and `Jitter` apply to  `Link` only.
 - `Delay` is a string with a value and a unit. For example, a 5 millisecond 
 delay is represented as `5ms`

### Using the config file
The config file is to be used by the `ltbnet` command-line program. To start 
a network using config file `config_9pmu.json`, run the following:

```bash
sudo ltbnet config_5pmu.json -v
```

This enables the verbose mode of LTBNet.
